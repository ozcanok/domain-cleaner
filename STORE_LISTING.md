## Detailed Description

Clean cache, cookies, and site data for the active tab's domain — not the entire browser. Domain Cleaner gives you precise, per-site control over what gets deleted, so you can troubleshoot websites, fix login issues, or free up storage without losing data from other sites.

★ PER-DOMAIN CLEANING
Unlike the built-in "Clear browsing data" which wipes everything, Domain Cleaner targets only the domain you're viewing. All other sites remain untouched.

★ 4 CLEANUP CATEGORIES
• Cache — HTTP cache, cache storage & offline data
• Cookies — Session & auth cookies
• History — Browsing history, downloads & form data
• Site Storage — Local storage, session storage & databases

Pick exactly what you want to clean. Every option has a clear label and description.

★ QUICK PRESETS
• Cache & Cookies — Everyday cleanup for most issues
• Deep Clean — Full domain reset with confirmation dialog

One click to select a preset, one click to clean and reload.

★ KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
• Alt+Shift+C — Cache & Cookies clean
• Alt+Shift+D — Deep Clean
• Alt+Shift+H — Clear Domain History
• Alt+Shift+I — Open in Incognito

All shortcuts are customizable at chrome://extensions/shortcuts.

★ RIGHT-CLICK CONTEXT MENU
Right-click on any page for quick access to:
• Cache & Cookies clean
• Deep Clean
• Clear Domain History
• Open in Incognito

★ LIVE PREVIEW
See cookie count and storage usage before you click Clean.

★ PER-OPTION RESULT BADGES
After cleaning, see exactly how many items were removed for each category.

★ HSTS CLEARING
One-click access to Chrome's HSTS settings page with the domain auto-copied to your clipboard.

★ OPEN IN INCOGNITO
Instantly open the current page in a new incognito window matching your current window size and state.

★ 9 LANGUAGES
English, Türkçe, Español, Deutsch, Français, Português, Русский, 日本語, 中文

★ PRIVACY FIRST
No data collection, no analytics, no external connections. Everything runs locally in your browser.
